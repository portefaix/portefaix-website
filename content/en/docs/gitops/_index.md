[OpenGitops principles](https://opengitops.dev):

* **Declarative**: A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively.
* **Versioned and Immutable**: Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability, versioning and retains a complete version history.
* **Pulled Automatically**: Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source.
* **Continuously Reconciled**: Software agents continuously observe actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.
